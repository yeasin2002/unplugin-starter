# Product Overview

This is an unplugin starter template for creating universal build plugins that work across multiple bundlers (Vite, Rollup, Webpack, esbuild, etc.).

The template provides a foundation for building and distributing NPM packages with TypeScript, featuring:
- Universal plugin architecture using unplugin
- Comprehensive tooling for testing, formatting, and type-checking
- Automated release management
- Modern ESM/CJS dual package exports

The starter includes a basic transform plugin that injects comments into code as a demonstration of the unplugin API.
